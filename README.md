# Scala Various Functions

## Methods
Basic function definitions in Scala.  

## Local Functions
Define a function within a function and hide it from other functions.  

## Function Literals
When instantiated at runtime, it becomes a function as a value.  

## Partially Applied Functions
A function call that does not pass all the arguments needed by the function.  

## Tail Recursion Functions
By recursing at the end of the function, the Scala compiler converts it to a loop operation.
